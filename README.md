# Industry project

During my career experience, one of my main tasks is to solve computer vision problems using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision technologies.
Here is part of the projects which I completed at my previous companies for their specific industrial problems.

These projects mainly focused on object segmentation and detection. For the object segmentation task, the main goal is to detect and segment people from the complex background, and the computer vision task is named "instance segmentation". For the object detection task, the main goal is to detect the keyjoints in the body, such as eyes, nose, wrist, shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle, etc.., this computer vision task is named "pose estimation".

## For pose estimation

In the folder "pose_estimation", you can find all the python scripts which are used for training, testing, and inference, especially:

* Detailed instruction about how to deploy and run the project can be found from the "README.md" file 
* I coded some very useful python scripts in the "scripts" folder for inference and other tasks, these scripts are easy to use for everyone.

## For instance segmentation

In the folder "instance_segmentation", all the scripts are used for instance segmentation, especially:

* Detailed instruction can be found in the "README.md" file as mentioned above.
* Some useful scripts can be found in the "demo" folder, used for inference and other tasks.

## For blind evaluation

In the folder "blind_evaluation", I coded some python scripts to visually evaluate the performance of 6 trained models from A to F.
