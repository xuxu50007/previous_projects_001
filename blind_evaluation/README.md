# Blind evaluation

To estimate different methods with the best mask and skeleton, generated 30 videos are randomly placed in a 3x2 grid with 6 methods labeled from A to F:

* hrnetbu_maskrcnn

* openpose_maskrcnn

* udp_maskrcnn

* hrnetbu_solov2

* openpose_solov2

* udp_solov2

Note: The above 6 methods are named by "pose estimation method" + "instant segmentation method".

## How to run

Download this project

#### Note:
Due to space limitï¼ŒI only uploaded the same temp.mp4 for each video folder "blindeval/skegho...".
